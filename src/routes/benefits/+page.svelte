<Subtitle title="Why Us" />

<p>
    BioMedizone NJ aims to help people grow as a community while also instilling
    knowledge about Biomedicine. If you are interested in Biomedicine or want to
    know more, this place is great for you. Even if you are not interested in
    Biomedicine, you can still take part in our events or assist us with our
    fundraisers! We are an approved non-profit organization meaning we can sign
    off on your volunteer hours with us and you could be eligible for the
    President's Volunteer Service Award!
